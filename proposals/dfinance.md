## Proposal to add DFinance to verified application subnet

Authorize `4qehi-lqyo6-afz4c-hwqwo-lubfi-4evgk-5vrn5-rldx2-lheha-xs7a4-gae` for subnet `pae4o-o6dxf-xki7q-ezclx-znyd6-fnk6w-vkv5z-5lfwh-xym2i-otrrw-fqe`

### Rational
This proposal aims to authorize the DFinance team to deploy apps on the verified application subnet.
We have already deployed an initial version of our app on the general application subnet: https://6t2ym-6aaaa-aaaah-qaawa-cai.raw.ic0.app/, hope that we 
can deploy our later versions to the verified application subnet.
